Aleksi Haapsaari and Anssi Kinnuned dropped from course before any coding work on the project was done.

As a result, Antti Laine and Ville Ahti wrote the application together.


Antti was responsible of the overall layout and event viewing details. Ville masterminded
the database and login functionality. Everything else was pretty much coded together with work here and there, as stuff came up.
GitHub commit history pretty much shows where each of us worked at a time.
